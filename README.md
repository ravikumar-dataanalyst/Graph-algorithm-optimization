In mathematics and computer science, a graph is a collection of nodes (also known as vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes. These edges may be directed or undirected, and they may have weights assigned to them. Graphs are a fundamental data structure used to represent various relationships between objects. Graphs are used in a wide array of real-world applications to model and solve complex problems:
•	Transportation Networks: Road networks, flight routes, and public transportation systems are often modelled using graphs to optimize routes and schedules.
•	Social Networks: Graphs represent connections between users on social media platforms, helping in friend recommendations and network analysis.
•	Internet and Web Pages: The Internet is a large graph of web pages interconnected through hyperlinks.
